--PEGGAME BACKGROUND--

The Peg Game is a simple game that can be played on a square board that is filled with holes 
arranged into rows and columns. In a typical game, a peg is placed into all but one hole.
Moves are made by "jumping" pegs - moving one peg over another into an empty hole on the board. 
The "jumped" peg is removed. The game continues until all but the last peg have been removed 
from the board or no valid moves are remaining.

2) type 'peggame/gameboard.txt' 
3) click on 'Display Board and Play!' button


if you want to pause the game and complete it at another time, 
simply click the 'Save' button to save your progress.
