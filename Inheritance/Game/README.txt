The game is composed of several classes, each with it's own methodology.


1) Attack -- This class represents an attack move that a mage can perform.
2) DamageType -- An enumeration that defines different types of damage.
3) Game -- The main class that runs the game.
4) Goat -- An abstract class representing generic character in the game. 
5) Mage -- A subclass of 'Goat' that represents a mage character. 

To play, run the 'Game' class. The health points of each mage will be printed out. You can modify the main method however you like.
