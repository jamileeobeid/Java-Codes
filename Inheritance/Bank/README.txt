Hello everyone;

This Java program simulates interest rates for different banks. It demonstrates the use of inheritance by showcasing interface, abstract classes, and dynamic behavior through random events. 


1) Bank -- An interface that defines a method for getting the rate of interest.
2) EmiratesBank -- A class that implements the 'Bank' Interface and provides a fixed rate of interest.
3) HSBC -- A class that implements the 'Bank' interface with a different interest rate.
4) Citibank -- Another implementation of the 'Bank' interface with it's own interest rate.
5) Main -- The main class that simulates the interest rates for different banks. It also introduces a random event where each bank's interest rate can change dynamically.
